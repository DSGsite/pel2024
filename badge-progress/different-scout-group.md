Jonas - Dragon Scouts Group
"Hi! On 20 May we had a Hong Kong and Beijing Online Exchange program. We shared about our local dishes. Although we faced many challenges, be it the slides or our lack of practise in speaking fluent Chinese, we managed to overcome these challenges and the program ran quite smoothly! It was nice to be able to share with Scouts from other countries about our unique food that makes us special!"
