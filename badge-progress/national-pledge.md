# National Pledge

I understand from the national pledge that we are citizens of Singapore and we must maintain racial harmony by not being discriminatory towards other races and uphold the national values, equality, justice and a democratic society, this is to achieve hapiness,prosperity and progress for Singapore. I also think we all need to our part for our country whether is it serving in Ns or helping in anyway you can. We can serve in various ways as well. Whether its in NS or just helping out in charity, it still counts. Age doesn't matter.
