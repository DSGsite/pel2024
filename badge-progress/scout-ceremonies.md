# Scout Ceremonies

During a Scout meeting, court of honour, campfire program, or special gathering, a well-presented ceremony will add meaning and enhance the experience. \
Ceremonies serve Scouting in a variety of ways. A simple or elaborate ceremony can: 

- communicate something significant is taking place! 
- accentuate an event or accomplishment!
- entertain!
- provide inspiration!

We all feel uplifted when we experience an impressive ceremony.  Through the years, creative ceremonies have perpetuated Scouting’s unique fascination, attraction, and timeless mystique. There’s a marked difference between, on one hand, saluting the American flag while repeating the Pledge of Allegiance in the same way for each meeting, and, on the other hand, adding a new dimension by impressively bringing out the colors in a well-rehearsed fashion followed by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance in conjunction with an informative narration describing its meaning.
There are a variety of ceremony ideas that can be adapted and applied for use during Scouting events that will elevate the occasion and provide positive outcomes.
